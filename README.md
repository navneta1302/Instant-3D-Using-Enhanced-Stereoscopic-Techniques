Instant 3D using Enhanced Stereoscopic Techniques is a project aimed at transforming 2D images into 3D using advanced stereoscopic techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The projectâ€™s primary objective is to create the 3Dify tool, which enhances depth perception in images, allowing users to experience multidimensional visualization without the need for special glasses. Designed with applications in fields such as medical imaging, education, and virtual design, this tool provides a more immersive and intuitive way to interact with visual data. The project emphasizes accessibility, offering real-time 3D rendering on standard hardware, and supports dynamic stereoscopic effects like wigglegrams for glasses-free depth perception.
